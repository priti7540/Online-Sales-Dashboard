# Online Sales Dashboard Design & Data Analysis
## Project Objective
As part of a business performance analysis initiative, I developed a comprehensive Online Sales Dashboard to provide management with real-time visibility into sales operations. The project aimed to deliver actionable insights, track sales KPIs, and optimize business decisions through data visualization and analysis.
## Dataset Used

## Key Responsibilities
 - Extracted, cleaned, and modeled sales data from source using csv.
 - Built interactive visualizations and charts to display:
 • Total Orders, Sales Quantity, Revenue, and Customer Metrics
 • Sales by Category, Payment Mode, Sub-Category, City, and Top Customers
 - Created dynamic filters for Category, City, and Quarter to enable in-depth data exploration.
 - Performed profitability analysis by visualizing Quarterly Profit/Loss with color-coded bars.
 - Analyzed monthly sales trends to identify peak (March) and low-performing (July) periods.
 - Delivered insights to support strategic decisions like targeting top-performing cities (Indore, Mumbai) and sub-categories (Sarees, Printers).
